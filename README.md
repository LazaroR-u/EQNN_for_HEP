## Introduction

The investigation of symmetries has long been a cornerstone in the analysis of physical systems. As formalized by Noetherâ€™s theorem, conserved quantities are inherently linked to the symmetries present within the system. In the realm of high-energy physics, the study of symmetries has played a pivotal role in shaping the Standard Model, which elucidates three of the four fundamental forces in nature. 

Recent research has showcased the efficacy of Equivariant Quantum Neural Networks (EQNNs) in leveraging symmetries within variational quantum machine learning (VQML), thereby augmenting model performance and efficiency. This project is dedicated to delving into a spectrum of symmetries, encompassing both discrete and continuous forms, to enrich the capabilities of EQNNs. The endeavor involves crafting a comprehensive framework for constructing Equivariant Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (EQCNNs) tailored to image symmetries like rotations and reflections over the X and Y axes. By establishing such a framework, the creation and application of equivariant neural networks will be streamlined, thus facilitating their deployment in addressing challenges encountered in high-energy physics.

Specifically, this work aims to use the implemented EQCNN to classify quark-versus-gluon-initiated jet events from the dataset constructed by [Andrews et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900220307002?via%3Dihub) and [electron-photon events](https://indico.cern.ch/event/567550/papers/2629451/files/7515-end-end-event_v4.pdf).
